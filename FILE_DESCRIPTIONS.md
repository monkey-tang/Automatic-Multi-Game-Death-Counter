# File and Folder Descriptions (Detailed - Matching README)

Detailed descriptions for commit messages, matching the README:

## Root Files

- **DeathCounterInstaller.exe** - Latest installer executable (v1.5). This is the main file users should download. Uses Git LFS for large file storage. Includes Python version compatibility checking and automatic Japanese language pack download for Sekiro support.

- **README.md** - This documentation file. Contains installation instructions, feature descriptions, repository structure, and troubleshooting information.

- **.gitattributes** - Git LFS configuration file. It tells Git which large files (e.g., `*.exe`) should be tracked by Git Large File Storage instead of directly in the Git repository. This prevents repository bloat and allows for easier management of large binaries.

- **.gitignore** - Git ignore rules. This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., temporary files, build artifacts, local configurations). It helps keep the repository clean and focused on source code.

- **cleanup_github_repo.ps1** - Utility PowerShell script used to organize the repository structure, remove old files, and copy the desired folder layout from a local reference folder. Helps maintain consistency between local development and GitHub repository.

- **create_release.ps1** - PowerShell script for creating GitHub releases. Can be used to automate the process of creating a new release with the installer executable as a downloadable asset.

## Folders

### All Contents/
Contains all the main application files and resources needed to run the Death Counter. These are the files extracted by the `DeathCounterInstaller.exe` and are essential for the daemon and GUI to function. Includes:
- `multi_game_death_counter.py` - Main daemon script that performs screen capture, OCR detection, and death counting
- `death_counter_gui.py` - GUI application for controlling the daemon and viewing death statistics
- `games_config.json` - Configuration file defining game-specific settings (capture regions, keywords, process names)
- `switch_game_manual.py` - Script for manually switching between games
- `change_monitor_id.py` - Utility for changing monitor detection settings
- `capture_debug_once.py` - Debug utility for capturing a single screen region for testing
- `reset_death_counter.py` - Script to reset death counts to zero
- `test_daemon_start.py` - Test script to diagnose daemon startup issues
- `deathcounteraction.cs` - Streamer.bot action file for integration
- Batch files (`.bat`) for starting, stopping, and managing the daemon
- Other utility scripts and configuration files

### Debug.Test/
Contains debug and testing utilities. These files are used for troubleshooting, testing OCR accuracy, and diagnosing issues with the death counter daemon. Useful for developers and advanced users who need to debug detection problems.

### Edit/
Contains development scripts and source files used to build and maintain the installer. This folder is primarily for developers who want to modify or rebuild the installer. Includes:
- `build_single_file.py` - Build script that packages all application files into a single installer script. This script embeds all necessary files (Python scripts, configs, batch files) into `DeathCounter_Installer_Standalone.py`.
- `DeathCounter_Installer_Standalone.py` - The standalone installer script generated by `build_single_file.py`. This is the Python script version of the installer before it's compiled into an `.exe` using PyInstaller.
- Source copies of application files (for reference during build process)
- Other development utilities and scripts
